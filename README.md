# 🎹 Strong Synthesizer

> **"Modular Virtual Analog, FM, and Granular Sound Synthesis Engine."**

A hybrid multi-engine software synthesizer combining low-level **C++ performance** with an asynchronous **Python workflow**. The core signal paths are rendered sample-by-sample, driven by an automated **miniaudio** backend link, and managed via direct `ctypes` bindings through a real-time **PySide6** desktop instrumentation panel.

## ✨ Core Synthesis Architectures

*   **Virtual Analog (VA) Engine**: Features polyphonic voice slots backed by a 3-oscillator sawtooth unison grid per voice, complete with real-time micro-detuning (MIDI CC 14) and pitch-wheel tracking.
*   **Hardware-Accurate FM Engine**: A fully expanded emulation of the classic Sega Genesis **Yamaha YM2612** chip, supporting all 8 native phase-cascade routing algorithms (0–7) and vintage `.VGM` register dump parsing.
*   **Stochastic Granular Engine**: Built for dynamic sample injection. Streams raw `.wav`/`.flac` files directly from Python into C++ memory grids, offering stochastic grain spawning, positional jitter, and linear pitch interpolation.
*   **Multi-Mode DSP Filter & Waveshaper**: Implements a highly stable Chamberlin State-Variable Filter (SVF) supporting dynamically switchable **Low-Pass (LPF)**, **High-Pass (HPF)**, and **Band-Pass (BPF)** modes. Features built-in saturation curves via an asymmetric hyperbolic tangent (\(\tanh\)) soft-clipping waveshaper with auto-gain compensation.
*   **Advanced LFO Modulator**: Features an expandable low-frequency oscillator capable of generating multiple routing waveforms (**Sine**, **Triangle**, **Sawtooth**, and **Square Pulse**) to modulate filter metrics in real-time.

## 🚀 Quick Start & Environment Verification

Execute this exact sequence of commands from the project root directory to prepare your workspace, build all native components, and launch the graphical dashboard.

### 1. Initialize the Workspace and Python Environment
This creates the project layout and installs all dependencies (including `PySide6`, `mido`, `soundfile`, and `python-rtmidi`) into an isolated virtual environment:
```bash
chmod +x scripts/setup.sh scripts/validate_build.sh
./scripts/setup.sh --force
source .venv/bin/activate
```

### 2. Run Automated C++ Compilation and Binding Tests
The CMake engine automatically downloads the official single-header `miniaudio.h` repository from source, compiles the static core engine alongside the shared object bridge (`libsynth_bridge.so`), and executes an integration test:
```bash
./scripts/validate_build.sh -c --run-python
```

### 3. Launch the Master Graphical UI Dashboard
Launches the fully integrated dark-themed orchestration desk interface. You can play audio notes using your computer keyboard (`Z, X, C, V...` and `Q, W, E, R...`), view output waves inside the real-time oscilloscope, load audio files into granular memory, and capture performances:
```bash
python3 -m src.bridge.gui_app
```

### 4. Alternative: Run the Unified CLI Panel Queries
```bash
# Display the active module status matrix mapping
python3 -m src.cli info

# Trigger an standalone diagnostic tone through the console
python3 -m src.cli test-note --mode fm --note 69
```

## 📁 Lossless Code & Performance Exporters

The synthesizer provides built-in multi-format audio exporters. Using the central master recording controller block, you can track session performance buffers and render output files using the following profiles:
*   **Universal Audio Renderers**: Export lossless session tracks into `.wav`, `.flac`, `.ogg`, or `.mp3` directly via `soundfile`.
*   **Advanced Preset Management**: Deep TOML patch serialization storing comprehensive dashboard states (filter modes, LFO types, and 4-operator ADSR matrices) to disk.
*   **Sonic Pi live-coding Exporter**: Converts active patch snapshots, algorithm choices, and cutoff values into playable, human-readable Ruby templates (`*.rb`).
